## vision
The big picture for this project is to define a structure for interactive storytelling and to provide infrastructure to improve those stories while they are already published.

## roadmap
### structure development
First of all a clear structure has to be defined to cover as much story telling scenarios as possible with the least possible complexity.

This structure has to be implemented on the server side with a REST interface.

The last step is to create a easy to use web client so users can start to created story world with a simple ui.
